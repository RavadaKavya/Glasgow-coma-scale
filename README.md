# Glasgow-coma-scale
Python code using GUI interface calculates the Glasgow coma scale and determines head injury severity. Being a widely utilized assessment tool, the Glasgow coma scale(GCS) objectively quantifies the extent of impaired consciousness in all types of acute medical and trauma patients. The scale evaluates patients based on their eye-opening, verbal, and motor responses. It is a widely recognized and utilized tool in clinical and research environments. Providing a structured and standardized GCS using an interface can ensure reliability and consistency in evaluating the score. GUI interface creates an intuitive, user-friendly interface that helps manage and communicate with a global network of devices and systems using concise and understandable views. Furthermore, users can easily interact with the network using sliders, buttons, and other graphical elements, making it efficient and intuitive. This interface improves communication, performance, and collaboration across the global network.
Healthcare professionals currently manually enter and compute GCS scores using traditional methods such as pen and paper, which consumes a lot of time and is prone to errors. Moreover, this approach can be challenging for new professionals in the GCS scoring system, leading to potential mismanagement and misinterpretation. To reduce the mistakes and save time, we must develop an automated GCS calculator to address these challenges. Accurately interpreting the results of GCS scores is crucial in assessing patient treatment, making a computerized calculator an imperative tool.
This project used Python and Tkinter libraries to develop the GUI interface and design a GCS calculator. We incorporated labels, radio buttons for eye, verbal, and motor responses, and the "Calculate GCS" button. Clicking on the button after inputting the response values will allow the program to retrieve the input values, thus applying them to the formula in the code to evaluate the GCS score. The program involves the Tkinter module in the message box and displays the GCS score in a display box with precision and adaptability. They conducted several trial runs using varied input values to ensure its reliability. The py installer has created a self-executable file that healthcare professionals can conveniently access anytime.
